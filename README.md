WildEye is a wildlife monitoring system aimed at promoting harmony between human habitats and forested areas. Cameras strategically placed at the interface between human settlements and forests are used to detect wildlife like elephants and tigers. Detected animals trigger alerts containing time, location, and images, which are sent to nearby devices and wildlife departments. Recent alerts are logged and accessible via dedicated app or web platform. Users can also privately report animal sightings. This project contributes to improving wildlife management and reduce human-wildlife conflicts
